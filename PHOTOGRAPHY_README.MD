# Photography Section Setup

Your website now includes a complete photography portfolio system that automatically updates when you add photos to your GitHub repository!

## üéØ How It Works

The photography system automatically:
- Loads photos from your GitHub repository
- Displays them in a beautiful, responsive gallery
- Shows the latest 3 photos on your homepage
- Organizes photos by location and date
- Provides search functionality
- Includes a modal viewer with navigation

## üìÅ Setting Up Your Photo Folder

1. **Create the photos directory** in your GitHub repository:
   ```
   assets/images/photography/
   ```

2. **Upload your photos** to this folder using GitHub's web interface or git commands

## üè∑Ô∏è Photo Naming Convention

For best results, name your photos using this format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_Location_Title.jpg
```

**Examples:**
- `2024-05-15_Naples_Italy_Sunset_Harbor.jpg`
- `2024-03-20_Rocky_Mountains_Colorado_Morning_Mist.jpg`
- `2024-01-10_New_York_City_Manhattan_Skyline.jpg`

**What each part does:**
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: Date taken (for chronological sorting)
- `Location`: Where the photo was taken (for location filtering)
- `Title`: Descriptive title (displayed as photo title)

## üì∏ Supported Formats

- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.gif`
- `.webp`

```

```

## üì± Mobile Optimization

The photography section is fully mobile-optimized with:
- Responsive grid layouts

- Mobile-specific UI adjustments

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Create the `assets/images/photography/` folder in your repository
2. Upload some photos using the naming convention above
3. Your photography section will automatically populate!

## üîç Troubleshooting

**Photos not showing?**
- Check that photos are in the correct folder: `assets/images/photography/`
- Ensure photo files have supported extensions (.jpg, .png, etc.)
- Verify your GitHub repository is public or API accessible

**Filters not working?**
- Make sure photo filenames include location information
- Use underscores or dashes to separate location parts

**Demo photos showing instead?**
- This happens when GitHub API is unavailable or no photos are found
- Upload photos to the correct folder to replace demo content

## üé® Advanced Tips

- **High-quality photos**: Upload high-resolution images for best quality
- **Consistent naming**: Use consistent location naming for better filtering
- **Descriptions**: Consider adding descriptions in filename or metadata
- **Organization**: Group photos by events or trips using date prefixes

Your photography portfolio is now ready to showcase your work automatically! Simply upload photos to GitHub and watch your website update instantly.
