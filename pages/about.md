## Professional Background

I am Andrew Erbs, a Yale School of Management MBA candidate with extensive leadership experience as a Lieutenant and Surface Warfare Officer in the United States Navy. My professional journey combines strategic planning, data analysis, crisis management, and organizational transformation across multiple high-stakes environments.

## Strategic Leadership & Planning

During my time with Naval Forces Europe, Naval Forces Africa, and Command Sixth Fleet in Naples, Italy, I served as a Naval Planner where I led comprehensive revisions of naval strategy across two continents. My work directly informed decision-making at the highest levels of government, including the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff, resulting in significant resource allocation improvements and operational efficiencies.

I'm particularly proud of my contributions to military planning systems, where I innovated new applications for command and control systems through database engineering. By implementing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for backend data, I enabled real-time planning capabilities that increased operational capacity by 100-fold.

## Technical Expertise & Data Analytics
My technical foundation begins with dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineering and Philosophy from The Pennsylvania State University, complemented by a minor in Military Studies. As a cybersecurity researcher with the Army Research Lab and the Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security Lab, I developed a deep understanding of technical systems and security principles.

I leverage my coding proficiency in Python, SQL, C, Java, and HTML to solve complex organizational challenges. Throughout my naval career, I've consistently applied data analytics to improve decision-making processes, create innovative dashboards, and enhance operational readiness.

## Crisis Management & Leadership
As Damage Control Assistant aboard USS Higgins, I led emergency response teams through over 40 crisis situations, protecting assets worth more than $2 billion. My leadership extended to revising over 700 pages of emergency procedures and training more than 600 personnel, resulting in exceptional assessment scores.

My experience as Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer and Fire Control Division Officer further honed my ability to perform under pressure while maintaining precision and accountability. Whether managing weapons systems or coordinating engineering preparations for congressional inspections, I've consistently delivered results that exceed expectations.

## Education & Certifications
I'm currently pursuing my MBA at Yale School of Management, where I'm an active member of the Tech & Society Club, Data Analytics Club, Media & Sports Club, Veterans Club, and Marketing Club. My academic credentials are complemented by professional certifications including:

Project Management Professional (PMP)
Harvard Business School Credential of Readiness (Accounting - Honors)

## Languages & Personal Interests

Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm fluent in English and have superior proficiency in Italian. My personal interests reflect my commitment to discipline and continuous improvement:

Trained in five different martial arts
Former nationally ranked Sabre fencer

##  Professional Philosophy

I believe in leveraging data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions while maintaining a holistic understanding of organizational goals and human factors. My approach combines technical expertise with strong leadership principles, always focused on developing systems and teams that can perform effectively under pressure.
    
Throughout my career, I've demonstrated the ability to transform organizations through process innovation, stakeholder engagement, and technical implementation. I'm passionate about creating scalable solutions that enable teams to achieve exceptional results, whether in military operations, business environments, or technical projects.

I look forward to connecting with professionals who share my interests in strategic leadership, data analytics, organizational transformation, and technical innovation.
